------------------------------------------- Unit Testing ---------------------------------------
---------------------------------------- TASK NUMBER 5 -----------------------------------------

Unit testing is an important step in the development process, because if done correctly, 
it can help detect early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in later testing stages.
Unit testing is done usually by developers and it is considered a good practice.

There are a lot of ways through which a developer can perform unit testing in his project,
during the development phase.

Unit Testing ways and Techniques : 
There are 3 types of Unit Testing Techniques. They are

Black Box Testing: This testing technique is used in covering the unit tests for input,
 		   user interface, and output parts.
White Box Testing: This technique is used in testing the functional behavior of the system 
		   by giving the input and checking the functionality output including the 
		   internal design structure and code of the modules.
Gray Box Testing:  This technique is used in executing the relevant test cases, test methods, 
		   test functions, and analyzing the code performance for the modules. 



Unit Testing Tools: 

Here are some commonly used Unit Testing tools: 
Jtest 
Junit 
NUnit 
EMMA
PHPUnit
Springboot 

Advantages of Unit Testing:
1) Unit Testing allows developers to learn what functionality is provided by a unit and how to use it to gain a basic understanding of the unit.
2) Unit testing allows the programmer to refine code and make sure the module works properly.
3) Unit testing enables testing parts of the project without waiting for others to be completed.

Disadvantages of Unit Testing:
1)The process is time-consuming for writing the unit test cases.
2)Unit Testing will not cover all the errors in the module because there is a chance of having errors in the modules while doing integration testing.
3)Unit Testing is not efficient for checking the errors in the UI(User Interface) part of the module.
4)It requires more time for maintenance when the source code is changed frequently.
5)It cannot cover the non-functional testing parameters such as scalability, the performance of the system, etc. 


We worked with Junit testing with netbeans IDE and each member started writing his own code and then wrote some test cases for our program.


--------------------------------------------------------- WORKING WITH JUNIT ----------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------  STEPS TO FOLLOW ----------------------------------------------

1) Create a Java Class where you will be writing all of your major functionalitiles and methods.
2) Create a Java Test class parallel to the Java class you created 
3) Add some test cases to the Java Test
4) add before and each metods accordingly and if necessary
5) right click on the code and select test file option
6) Test executing will get started and report will be shown to you.
